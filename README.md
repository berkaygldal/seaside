## GNU Seaside
### For some reason, currently in the latest compiled bulid, every time you open the app you have to install every package again

Seaside is a basic shell alternative designed for file management tasks on Windows. It provides a lightweight and efficient command-line interface for handling files and directories. With a minimalistic design, Seaside focuses on simplicity, speed, and ease of use, making it an ideal tool for users who need an alternative to traditional file management methods.

Seaside allows users to navigate directories, manage files, and perform essential operations without relying on graphical interfaces. This makes it a valuable tool for system administrators and power users who prefer command-line efficiency. While having executables only on Windows, we are actively seeking a volunteers to help with Linux versions.
